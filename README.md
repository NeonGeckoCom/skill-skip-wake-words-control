## skill-permit-audio-recording
Skill, which lets the user switch between standard "wake-words" mode and "Always On"

## Description
Skill, which works using Mycroft-core with NeonGeckoCom modifications, provides the user with the functionality to choose between continuous audio recording, which would not require wake words for Mycroft to work, and the "standard" mode, where the wake word "Hey Mycroft" is required.
In addition, this skill allows the user to modify their audio and text recording permissions, which is essential for the "my coupons" skill and general user privacy.
Skill works with wide variety of potential requests phrases.

Note: This skill would not proceed without the clear confirmation of the command from the user by asking "Should I stop skipping wake words?" and expecting a positive answer.

## Examples
* "Start skipping wake words"
* "Stop skipping wake words"
* "stop audio coupons"
* "deny audio deals"
